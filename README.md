###
Datalore Plot is a library for statistical graphics written in `Kotlin` programming language.

The design of Datalore Plot library is heavily influenced by Leland Wilkinson work [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2549408.The_Grammar_of_Graphics) describing the deep features that underlie all statistical graphics.

> This grammar [...] is made up of a set of independent components that can be composed in many different ways. This makes [it] very powerful because you are not limited to a set of pre-specified graphics, but you can create new graphics that are precisely tailored for your problem.
> - Hadley Wickham, "ggplot2: [Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6829192-ggplot2)"



Due to the unique mutli-platform nature of `Kotlin` programming language, we can have the same graphing functionality packaged as JavaScript library, JVM library and a native Python extension.

### Python Extension 

[Learn](README_PYTHON.md) how to create plots in Jupyter using Datalore Plot python package.
