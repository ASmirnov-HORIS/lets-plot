- Jupyter must be installed in Python environment (IPython.display is required)

- edit paths to python in python-extension/src/nativeInterop/cinterop/python.def

- build project (gradle)

In terminal:
    - create/activate Python environment (I use conda)
    - cd to datalore-plot/python-package
    - copy all JS to package data: python setup.py updatejs
    - build `wheel`:    python setup.py bdist_wheel
    - install wheel to Python from local dist:  pip install --no-index --find-links=dist/ datalore-plot
        If `datalore-plot` was already installed - uninstall: pip uninstall datalore-plot


Start local web-server to serve our js scripts (from /datalore-plot/visualization-demo-plot/build/demoWeb/lib):
    - cd to datalore-plot/visualization-demo-plot/build/demoWeb/lib
    - python -m http.server 8080
Note: this step is not necessary is our JS is injected into notebook from the package resources (the default currently)


View a plot:
    - in Jupyter notebook try code:

        from datalore.plot.hello import plotgg
        plotgg()

Sample bar plot should show up.
