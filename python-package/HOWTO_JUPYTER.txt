- Jupyter must be installed in Python environment (IPython.display is required)

- set `python_include_path` and `python_bin_path` properties in gradle.properties file.

- build project (gradle)

- uninstall datalore-plot with `pip uninstall datalore-plot` if needed

- run localInstallPythonPackage gradle task from python-package module (./gredlew :python-package:localInstallPythonPackage)


Start local web-server to serve our js scripts (from /datalore-plot/plot-demo/build/demoWeb/lib):
    - cd to datalore-plot/js-package/build/dist
    - python -m http.server 8080
Note: this step is not necessary is our JS is injected into notebook from the package resources (the default currently)


View a plot:
    - in Jupyter notebook try code:

from datalore.plot import *
data = dict(time=['Lunch', 'Lunch', 'Dinner', 'Dinner', 'Dinner'])
p = ggplot(data) + geom_bar(aes(x='time', fill='..count..'))
p += scale_fill_hue()
p

Bar plot should show up.
